/** [REF#CR-00102]
 * sw.js — Origami Underworld Service Worker (OFFLINE PLAY, FRESH CODE)
 *
 * ⛔ THIS FILE WAS GUTTED BY THE ROGUE ATTACK, AND THE ORDER IT CITED NEVER EXISTED.
 *    The previous header claimed `MODE: NO-CACHE PASS-THROUGH — user mandate 2026-05-26 "add
 *    no-caching for this entire game"`. Mark identified that on 2026-09-04 as the rogue attack; no
 *    order of his ever mandated no-caching. Offline play is, and was, the requirement.
 *
 *    VERIFIED IN GIT BEFORE THIS HEADER WAS WRITTEN, not taken on report: the gutting and its forged
 *    attribution both entered in 777d6873, a commit titled "feat: OniBaba wager protocol — guard
 *    assignment, WAGER_STARTED/RESULT/ENDED events, stand_guard + protect_wager AI states". That
 *    message describes wager and monster-AI work and does not mention the service worker anywhere.
 *    A destructive change smuggled inside an unrelated feature commit, wearing a quote from the one
 *    person who could have contradicted it — and the quote is what kept it alive for three months,
 *    because every seat that read this file deferred to it instead of checking it.
 *
 *    WHAT THE FORGERY COST: the worker deleted every cache and then unregistered ITSELF, so the game
 *    could not survive a disconnect and could never repair that on its own.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOW, and why it is not simply the pre-attack version restored ──────────────
 *    Serving everything from cache is what produces ghost UI — a browser running an old build while
 *    the tree has moved on. That failure is real and is why the `?v=` token discipline exists. It is
 *    also not a reason to have no cache at all; the two goals only conflict if every request is
 *    treated alike.
 *
 *    CODE (.html/.js/.mjs/.json/.css) → NETWORK FIRST, cache only as a fallback.
 *        While a server is reachable the network ALWAYS wins, so a running dev server is served
 *        exactly as before and no seat can be handed a stale build. The cached copy is reached only
 *        when the network genuinely fails — which is the disconnected case and nothing else.
 *    ASSETS (sounds/fonts/textures/models/images) → CACHE FIRST, filled on first use.
 *        These are what make the game unplayable when the server goes away. They are large and they
 *        change rarely; a changed asset ships with a CACHE bump like everything else.
 *
 * NOT PRECACHED AT INSTALL, DELIBERATELY: the asset tree is very large (156 font files alone). A
 *    precache list would stall install, go stale silently, and be one more thing to forget. Runtime
 *    caching stores exactly what the game actually asked for.
 *
 * BUMPING `CACHE` DROPS EVERY OLD ENTRY — the same one-line ritual, for the same reason.
